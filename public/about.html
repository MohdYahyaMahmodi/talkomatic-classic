            <h1>About Talkomatic - The First Multi-User Chat Room</h1>
            <p>Talkomatic is an online platform for real-time text communication, essentially a chat room. Unlike conventional chat services, Talkomatic allows you to see messages being typed in real-time, letter by letter, providing an immediate and engaging experience.</p>
            <p>What makes Talkomatic truly unique is its historical significance: <span class="highlight">Talkomatic is the world's first multi-user chat room</span>, created in 1973 on the PLATO system, predating IRC (1988) and CompuServe's "CB Simulator" (1980).</p>

The server runs on Node.js and Socket.IO, while the client software uses the jQuery library and operates within a web browser.
